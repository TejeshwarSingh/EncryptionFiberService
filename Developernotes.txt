After running the above commands, you can send POST requests to http://localhost:3050/encrypt and http://localhost:3050/decrypt with a 
form parameter named text to test encryption and decryption, respectively.

Note: The encryption key used here (secretKey) is hardcoded for simplicity. In a real-world scenario, you'd want to use a secure method to store and retrieve this key.
